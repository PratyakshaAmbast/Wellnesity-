		<h2> Anxiety Disorder</h2></br>
		<p>Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life.</br>The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships.</p>
		</br>
		<h1>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h1>
		<p>People with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) display excessive anxiety or worry, most days for at least 6 months, about a number of things such as personal health, work, social interactions, and everyday routine life circumstances.</p>
		<br>
		<p><u>Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms include:</u></p>
			<p>*Feeling restless, wound-up, or on-edge</br>
			*Being easily fatigued</br>
			*Having difficulty concentrating; mind going blank</br>
			*Being irritable</br>
			*Having muscle tension</br>
			*Difficulty controlling feelings of worry</br>
			*Having sleep problems, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, restlessness, or unsatisfying sleep</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong><u>Treatment & Therapy</u></strong></p>
		<p>Anxiety disorders are generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. </br>There are many ways to treat anxiety and people should work with their doctor to choose the treatment that is best for them.</p>
		<p>Psychotherapy
		<p>Psychotherapy or “talk therapy” can help people with anxiety disorders. To be effective, psychotherapy must be directed at the person’s specific anxieties and tailored to his or her needs.</p>

		<h1>Depression</h1>
		<p>Depression (major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. </br>It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working</p><br>
		<p>1.<u>Persistent depressive</u> disorder (also called dysthymia) is a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder.</p>
		</br><p>2.<u>Postpartum depression</u> is much more serious than the “baby blues” (relatively mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery) that many women experience after giving birth. Women with postpartum depression experience full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression). The feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that accompany postpartum depression may make it difficult for these new mothers to complete daily care activities for themselves and/or for their babies.
		</br><p>3.<u>Psychotic depression</u> occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations). The psychotic symptoms typically have a depressive “theme,” such as delusions of guilt, poverty, or illness.
		</br><p>4.<u>Seasonal affective disorder</u> is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This depression generally lifts during spring and summer. Winter depression, typically accompanied by social withdrawal, increased sleep, and weight gain, predictably returns every year in seasonal affective disorder.
		</br><p>5.<u>Bipolar disorder</u> is different from depression, but it is included in this list is because someone with bipolar disorder experiences episodes of extremely low moods that meet the criteria for major depression (called “bipolar depression”). But a person with bipolar disorder also experiences extreme high – euphoric or irritable – moods called “mania” or a less severe form called “hypomania.”</p>
		</br><br><p><strong><u>Signs and Symptoms</u></strong></p>
		</p>If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:</p>

			<P>*Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood<br>
			*Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism<br>
			*Irritability<br>
			*Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness<br>
			*Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities<br>
			*Decreased energy or fatigue<br>
			*Moving or talking more slowly<br>
			*Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong><u>Treatment and Therapies</u></strong></p>
			<p>Depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. The earlier that treatment can begin, the more effective it is. Depression is usually treated with medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and other brain stimulation therapies may be options to explore.</p>

		<h1>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder(OCD)</h1>
		<p>It  is a common, chronic, and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and/or behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.</p>
		<br>
		<p><u>Signs and Symptoms</u></p>
		<p><b>Obsessions</b> are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. </br>Common symptoms include:<br>
			Fear of germs or contamination<br>
			Unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, or harm<br>
			Aggressive thoughts towards others or self<br>
			Having things symmetrical or in a perfect order</p><br>
		<p><b>Compulsions </b>are repetitive behaviors that a person with OCD feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. <>Common compulsions include:
			Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing<br>
			Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way<br>
			Repeatedly checking on things, such as repeatedly checking to see if the door is locked or that the oven is off<br>
			Compulsive counting</p>
			<br>
			<p><u>Treatments and Therapies</u></p>
				OCD is typically treated with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two.<br> Although most patients with OCD respond to treatment, some patients continue to experience symptoms.<br>
				Sometimes people with OCD also have other mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphic disorder, a disorder in which someone mistakenly believes that a part of their body is abnormal. <br>It is important to consider these other disorders when making decisions about treatment.</p>

		<h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD)</h2>
		<p>It is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event.</p></br>
		<p><u>Signs and Symptoms</u></p><br>
		<p>To be diagnosed with PTSD, an adult must have all of the following for at least 1 month:<br>
			At least one re-experiencing symptom<br>
			At least one avoidance symptom<br>
			At least two arousal and reactivity symptoms<br>
			At least two cognition and mood symptoms</p><br>
		<p><u>Therapies and Treatments</u></p>
		<p>The main treatments for people with PTSD are medications, psychotherapy (“talk” therapy), or both. Everyone is different, and PTSD affects people differently, so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another. <br>It is important for anyone with PTSD to be treated by a mental health provider who is experienced with PTSD.<br> Some people with PTSD may need to try different treatments to find what works for their symptoms.
		<br><br>
		If someone with PTSD is going through an ongoing trauma, such as being in an abusive relationship, both of the problems need to be addressed. <br>Other ongoing problems can include panic disorder, depression, substance abuse, and feeling suicidal.<p>
